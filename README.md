# D Merge(Early development stage)

diff & merge => d_merge json patch-based hkx patch

- Current serde_hkx ver. 0.6.0

## For Tester

The patch page is under development, so there is no need to submit an issue.

Convert page problem

- For the look and feel, Write d_merge issue
- Conversion feature bugs should be written in serde_hkx issues

- [Release(For test)](https://github.com/SARDONYX-sard/d-merge/releases)

## How to debug Nemesis Patches?

1. Generate hkx in Nemesis.
2. Convert the required xml in Nemesis/resource to hkx and then to xml again.
   This will generate xml that meets the d-merge specification.
3. Output the xml generated in step 2 to json for 3.
4. Use serde-hkx tool to output Nemesis hkx â†’ json.
5. Diff the results of 3 and 4.

## Implementation

- [x] Convert page
- [ ] Patch page <- current working
- [x] settings page

  - [ ] Serialization
  - [x] Deserialization
- info.txt searcher.
- Merge
  - [x] Parallel json patch
  - [x] Fix range add operation of Array
  - [ ] Prioritization and conflict resolution among patches, optimization by
        merging

## Extra build

- json, yaml support

## `Package.json` notes

Comments cannot be written in `Package.json`, so write them here.

Note that the following version must be fixed or it will not work for some
reason.

- Biome:
  - version: 1.9.3
  - VS Code extension: 2.2.3

- mui/x-data-grid, when changing from `7.22.2` to `7.23.1`, the `setState` in
  `handleRowSelectionModelChange` is now

  `Cannot update a component () while rendering a different component ()` and
  therefore do not use "7.23.1".

- `React19` is a new ver. stabilized on 2024/12/5, so `notistack`,
  `@monaco-editor/react` warns. In that case, use `npm i --force`.
