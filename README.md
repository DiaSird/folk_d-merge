## For Tester

The patch page is under development, so there is no need to submit an issue.

- [Early Release](https://github.com/SARDONYX-sard/d-merge/releases)

## Patch Page Progress

This currently works to some extent(Sliding, Paraglider, MCO, DMCO-Dodge, ...), but there seems to be a conflict where the patch changes every time the button is pressed.

The only thing we are considering at this time is support for the Nemesis patch.(Since I only use the Nemesis patch).

- Nemesis Patch

  - [ ] Fix unknown merge race condition

## Debugging Nemesis Patches

1. Generate hkx in Nemesis.
2. Convert the required xml in Nemesis/resource to hkx and then to xml again.
   This will generate xml that meets the d-merge specification.
3. Output the xml generated in step 2 to json for 3.
4. Use serde-hkx tool to output Nemesis hkx â†’ json.
5. Diff the results of 3 and 4.

## Converting page
